Hi!

I am Aggelos Bellos. I learn from the mistakes who listen my advice.

My day to day work is to advocate Domain Driven Design and Test Driven Development. When I don't annoy people about these things, I usually annoy them by adding new rules in the static analysis tools and in the CI process in general.
Beyond the code, I am deeply fascinated by socio-technical systems, exploring how social dynamics influence technical architectures and vice versa. This is also the reason why I will annoy you too in the conference.
In my free time, I delve into scalability challenges and design patterns, sharing insights and solutions on my [blog](https://medium.com/@aggelosbellos).
